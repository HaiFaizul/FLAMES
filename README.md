## What is FLAMES? ðŸ”¥

FLAMES is a popular game played by many, especially in school days, to predict the relationship status between two people. The acronym stands for:

*   **F** - Friends
*   **L** - Lovers
*   **A** - Affectionate
*   **M** - Marriage
*   **E** - Enemies
*   **S** - Siblings

The game involves:
1.  Writing down two names.
2.  Striking out common letters between the two names.
3.  Counting the total number of remaining (un-struck) letters. Let this count be `N`.
4.  Using the FLAMES acronym, repeatedly count `N` letters, striking out the letter where the count ends. The process continues with the remaining letters until only one letter from FLAMES is left. This final letter is the predicted relationship.
